			<h2>Background</h2>

			<p>
				I was born and raised in Calgary, Canada and developed an interest in computers at a young age. Growing up, I spent weekends and summers taking programming classes and reading books on software development. I eventually narrowed my focus to how humans use computers to tell stories, create fictional worlds, and share emotional experiences.
			</p>
			<p>
				I completed my undergraduate education at Emerson College in Boston, receiving a BFA in Writing &amp; Literature and a B.Sc. in Political Communication with honors. Pursuing my passion for understanding digital media in a social contect, I received an MA in Emerging Media Studies from Boston University and am currently working on completing my PhD.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I am not researching or teaching, I can either be found hiking, snowshoeing, or kayaking in the Great Outdoors, or playing video games, constructing virtual experiences, or writing and performing poetry in a basement somewhere.

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>
				My research focuses on understanding how users process <em>immersive environments</em> and <em>interactive narratives</em> on cognitive and emotional levels. I conduct psychological experiments in the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/com/research/communication-research-center/" target="_blank">Communication Research Center</a> using video games and virtual reality technology. In the past, I have drawn from both commercially-available and custom-designed entertainment software to form the basis of the stimuli I use.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also conduct resarch on online harassment and cyberbullying, particularly within online communities and subcultures, with the aim of making gaming culture less toxic while also promoting a free exchange of ideas.
